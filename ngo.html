                            <p class=" universal-font-size">This environmental NGO is a classic example of how digital channels can be used in the protection and conservation of the environment. SankalpTaru is an e-NGO, which aims at promoting tree plantation across the country. The NGO is active in 21 states in India. The plantation drive is run on a digital platform, allowing SankalpTaru to use innovative technologies such as GPS-tagging and others. This way, the volunteers can track the progress of plantation drives. So far, millions of trees have been planted since SankapTaru’s inception by Apurva Bhandari in 2013.
                                The plantation drives are strategically planned so that they reach various strata of the society. The NGO involves all the aspects of environmental protection – rural development, cleaner schools, tree plantation in cities and community-based land protection.  Their principal aim is to create a greener, cleaner and healthier environment so that our future generations get a better and greener planet with even richer bio-diversity and abundant natural resources.
